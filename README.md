On this project I am creating a website listing some of my favorite recipes. In doing so, I am able to practice basic command line skills, the use of git commands and GitHub,
a text code editor, in this case, VSCode, linking other webpages and images to my site, editing files, creating unordered and ordered lists,
and writing boilerplate for an HTML document.
